# Build Log — Subsense-web

Append-only, most-recent-first traceability log of build steps, the prompts that drove them, and how each step was verified. This lives inside the code repo (not the IIT Capstone governance docs) because it's a record of *implementation activity*, not product/architecture decisions — those still belong in `08_Decision_Log`.

Two things keep this current automatically:
1. A git `post-commit` hook (`.git/hooks/post-commit`, local-only — not versioned by git itself) appends a one-line entry for every commit: timestamp, hash, message.
2. `CLAUDE.md` instructs Claude Code to append a full entry here — the prompt it was given, what it built, and how it verified the work — before committing each task, using the template below.

**Verification:**
- <build/lint/test results>
- <manual smoke test results, if any>

**Commit:** <hash> — "<commit message>"

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 2: Authentication and Profile

**Prompt:**
Implement Phase 2 (Authentication and Profile) for SubSense per 16_Implementation_Roadmap and 11_API_Integration_Architecture. Goals: Google Sign-In, first-login provisioning, profile/preferences load, protected routes. Critical rules: BR-002, BR-006, BR-007, BR-008. DB-side provisioning (`handle_new_user()` trigger) already exists — frontend must only read, never write provisioning logic. Build `AuthContext.tsx` (AuthProvider + `useAuth()` hook), `AuthPage.tsx` (Google Sign-In button), `ProtectedRoute.tsx` (session guard) in `src/features/auth/`. Wire `App.tsx` with `react-router-dom`: `/auth` public, `/` protected wrapping existing `SubscriptionsDemo` as an interim landing page. No header/sidebar/nav (Phase 3 scope), no new routes beyond `/auth` and `/`. Add a minimal sign-out control without touching `SubscriptionsDemo.tsx`. Run build/lint and confirm BR-002/006/007/008 compliance.

**What was done:**
- Created `src/features/auth/AuthContext.tsx`, `AuthPage.tsx`, `ProtectedRoute.tsx`.
- Wired `src/App.tsx`: `BrowserRouter`, `AuthProvider`, `/auth` and `/` routes, fixed-position sign-out button.
- Added `react-router-dom` dependency.
- Fixed a pre-existing TS5101 `baseUrl`-deprecated error that was hard-blocking `tsc -b` (added `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` to `tsconfig.app.json` — TypeScript's own suggested one-line fix, no behavior change; a proper fix later would be switching `moduleResolution` to `"bundler"` to drop `baseUrl` entirely).

**Verification:**
- `npm run build`: passes (one advisory chunk-size warning only, not an error).
- `npm run lint`: 4 `react-refresh/only-export-components` errors — 3 pre-existing in shadcn-generated files (confirmed via `git diff HEAD`, untouched), 1 new in `AuthContext.tsx` (exports both `AuthProvider` and `useAuth` from one file, matching the requested file structure over lint-cleanliness; dev-fast-refresh-only impact, not correctness).
- Manual smoke test (user-performed): Google Sign-In round-trip completed successfully, landed on `/` with session active; new rows confirmed created in Supabase Table Editor for `public.users`, `public.user_profiles`, `public.user_preferences`; sign-out correctly returned to `/auth`.
- BR-002/006/007/008: all confirmed satisfied (protected route gates `/`, provisioning is fully DB-trigger-owned with no frontend write path, loading state + request-counter guard prevent stale/partial data exposure).

**Commit:** (see next entry — logged automatically by the post-commit hook)
